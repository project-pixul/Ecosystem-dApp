			<h1><span>How do I buy Pixul Token?<br/></span></h1>
			<p>Pixul is launched on the Binance Smart Chain. This means that in order to buy Pixul, you need the
				Binance Coin (BNB). You can buy BNB from <a href="https://trustwallet.com/"
															target="_blank">Trustwallet</a>, Binance Smart Chain wallet,
				or from an exchange such as Binance itself, Crypto.com, Whitebit, or similar. Once you have BNB, send them to
				your wallet and <a target="_blank"

					over to PancakeSwap</a> to buy Pixul for BNB. Make sure you set your slippage to 8%.<br/></p>
			<h1><span>How do I stake?<br/></span></h1>
			<p>Go to <a href="staking">our &quot;Staking&quot; page</a>. It will automatically ask you to connect
				your wallet, connect the wallet that contains your Pixul Tokens. You will see your wallet information
			appear and the total amount of Pixul Tokens that you own in your wallet. We do not charge any fees for staking
				but you have to have BNB in your wallet in order to pay for the Binance SmartChain gas fees. Make sure you keep enough
				BNB in your wallet to claim or unstake you Pixul Tokens in the future. When you are all set
				use the slidebar to select how many Pixul Tokens you wish to stake. Press the &quot;Stake&quot; button to stake the
				amount of Pixul tokens you entered. Now your Pixul Tokens are staked and you'll earn 5% APY.</p>
			<h1><span>How do I claim my rewards?<br/></span></h1>
			<p>When you have staked your Pixul Tokens you're able to claim your rewards anytime you wish. Just press the &quot;Claim&quot; button
				in <a href="staking">our &quot;Staking&quot; page</a> and your rewards will be automatically transferred
				to your wallet. Make sure you have enough BNB in your wallet to pay for the gas fees.</p>
			<h1><span>How do I unstake my Pixul Tokens?<br/></span></h1>
			<p>Go to <a href="staking">our &quot;Staking&quot; page</a> and press the &quot;Unstake&quot; button. All of your staked
			Pixul Tokens and your rewards will be automatically transferred to your wallet.

			<h1><span>Is the liquidity locked?<br/></span></h1>
			<p>Yes, <a href="https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf5ec7ea50fffba3e1c2ab21f9bd3a7e29d11791b523f6af36ebd1bb5e145ec6c"
					   target="_blank">we have locked the liquidity</a> until the release of PixulSwap. At which point,
				we will only be unlocking it for testing, and then immediately locking it again for the remainder of our existence.<br/></p>
			<h1><span>Has the founder revealed his identity?<br/></span></h1>
			<p>Yes, the identity of the team members are revealed on <a href="about">our &quot;About&quot; page</a>. Our
				founder is called Ismail van Essen and you can find him <a
					href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismail-van-essen-b6936628/">on LinkedIn</a>.</p>
			<h1><span>Is it safe to stake my tokens on the staking website?<br/></span></h1>
			<p>Yes, we have extensive security measures in place to ensure the upmost protection of our clients&#39; assets.
				Please <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xf9a3fda781c94942760860fc731c24301c83830a#code" target="_blank">review our
					smart contract</a> during your own research to confirm the security for yourself.<br/></p>
			<h1><span>Why is the price in my Trustwallet sometimes incorrect?<br/></span></h1>
			<p>Trustwallet derives its pricing from CoinMarketCap&#39;s embedded API, and this service has been known to have
				incorrect and inflated pricing on smaller tokens. One reason for this is that they don&#39;t update the
				price as frequently in order to save resources.<br/></p>
			<h1><span>What sets your project apart from all of the others?<br/></span>
			</h1>
			<p>Plain and simple; we are the only project that is planning to divert a part of the fees from our upcoming
				PixulSwap exchange to a treasury wallet. The community will use this to decide what environmental
				organizations we should donate to throughout the year, instead of being greedy and pocketing
				everything.<br/></p>
